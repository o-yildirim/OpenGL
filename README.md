2D Game Engine - Work in progress

This is a very early version of a 2D game engine written in C++.

What you can do:
- Render basic shapes (circle, rectangle).
- Basic transformations such as rotating, moving and scaling objects.
- Picking objects with mouse.
- Scene logic and UI for that.
- Scene save/load.

To-do list:
- Rigidbody and collider components.
- Improvement on Camera UI in the components menu.
- Rendering textures.
- Tilemaps.
- Scripting engine.
- Refactoring.
